If you choose inheriting, you can get part of the resources of your previous gamecycle and (gamecycle number - 1) skillpoints. Note that savepoint will disappear after inheriting, and only by reaching maxlevel can you record savepoint again. \ne.g. You have a 3-gamecycle savepoint. Then you start a 1-gamecycle new game, reach maxlevel, and record savepoint. The new 2-gamecycle savepoint(in new game the number would be 2) would overwrite the 3-gamecycle savepoint.\n\nSpecialist mode can be enabled at any gamecycle to stengthen enemies.",
